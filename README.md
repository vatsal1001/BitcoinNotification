# Bitcoin Notification

I made a bitcoin notification application, inspired by the show Silicon Valley. What the application does is refer to an API and determine when the rate for bitcoin is negative which triggers a notification sound.
 
I ended up learning a bit about APIs and the requests library for Python, as well as how to play audio files with the help of the `simpleaudio` library.
